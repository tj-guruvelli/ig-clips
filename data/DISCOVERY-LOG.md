## 2026-07-22 — Daily discovery run (X/Twitter + speaker search)

**@theaibolt refresh:** Apify `apify/instagram-reel-scraper` sweep (200-result limit, 142 items returned of 143 known posts) found **zero new posts** since the last sweep — posted_urls list unchanged. No pruning needed this run. Speaker saturation on theaibolt: Jensen Huang 15, Sam Altman 14, Dario Amodei 11, Elon Musk 12, Geoffrey Hinton 5, Zuckerberg 9, Mo Gawdat 3, Bengio 1.

**Seed audit:** the 22 clips seeded earlier today (competitor theme-page sweep of @airesearches/@evolving.ai/@thewizeai/@theaipage, table above) were reviewed against the FORMAT criterion and **rejected wholesale** — every one is AI-generated/CGI video (sports recreations, robot fights, meme edits) with no real speaker (`speaker` field empty on all 22). None were promoted to the backlog. This confirms the routine's own warning that most 1M+ AI content on IG theme pages is AI-generated video, not real-person interviews.

**Discovery (available < 100, topped up):** ran the two untried levers flagged in the 2026-07-09 status note — (a) X/Twitter search via `api-ninja/x-twitter-advanced-search`, untried until now; (b) direct speaker-name + cross-industry keyword search on Instagram via `data-slayer/instagram-search-reels`, covering Tier 2/3 AI researchers and non-tech fields (medicine, law, finance, music, sports, publishing, film, politics). Three parallel searches, ~40 queries total.

**Result:** +9 clean additions to `available`, +5 flagged to `review` (too-short duration or unconfirmed source/authenticity), +1 view-count refresh (Jeremy Grantham 6.8M → 7.58M — the cross-industry search re-surfaced this existing backlog clip rather than a new one).

Backlog now **19/100 available** (was 10), **6 review** (was 1). Still well short of the 90-alert threshold — IG keyword search on individual speaker names mostly surfaces sub-1M aggregator reposts (e.g. Andrej Karpathy searches topped out at 366K views across 24 results), confirming the account-list exhaustion already noted 2026-07-09 extends to speaker-name search too. X/Twitter search is the most promising underused lever going forward and deserves deeper investment (more query variants, media-type/engagement tuning) in future runs. The Priority-1 lever (mining the original full-length source interview behind each of theaibolt's 143 posts to find proven 1M+ candidates) was **not attempted** this run — the scope (143 individual source-research lookups) is too large for a single session; flagging as a dedicated future-run project.

Pillar mix this batch skewed heavily Controversial (7 of 9) since safety/warning stories were the highest-yield content this run — future sourcing should target more Educational/Inspirational picks to rebalance toward the target mix (Educational majority, ~25% Controversial, ~10% Emotional, remainder Inspirational).

## 2026-07-23 — X/Twitter search top-up (+9 net-new, union-deduped by shortcode)

**Backlog status at run start:** 25/100 available (post 2026-07-22 batch), well short of the 90-alert threshold.

**Discovery:** continued X/Twitter search via `api-ninja/x-twitter-advanced-search`, focused on Anthropic/DeepMind-adjacent speakers not yet in the backlog (Dario Amodei, Demis Hassabis, Andrej Karpathy) plus a non-CEO finance voice (Krishna Rao) and a contrarian media voice (Ed Zitron).

**Result:** +9 clean additions, all promoted directly to `available` (no review-tier flags this batch). Backlog now **34/100 available** (was 25). Still well short of 90 — no BACKLOG NEAR CAP alert warranted.
